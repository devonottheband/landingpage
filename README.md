Project n.2: Landing Page
---------------

# HTML and CSS
I kept the original HTML and CSS structure, with small changes, to focus myself in learning JS. The first version of the code, not uploaded, included the navigation menu in HTML-CSS: I changed into a JS to follow the guidelines of the project rubric. 

# JS
I had just a basic knowledge of JS, I pushed in the last days before approaching Lesson n.2, about JS and the DOM. I think this is the main reason why my JS code in the navigation menu has a strong connection to the HTML (the same result could have been done using JS only, for example making the sections a Class), making the HTML ul as an object in JS. 

# Note: Why JS and not Javascript?
Because of [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Trademark), I prefer to use JS thanks to the inspiration given by [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify) whose books are helping me in getting unlocked from my current position of "full STUCK developer" as a newbie and a learner.
